# Contributing to Leptix

Contributions are of course always welcome. Unfortunately web technology is volatile and sometimes lacks desired
features/behavior that you have to end up implementing yourself.

## Guidelines

There aren't any super strict or formal guidelines, the only things we ask of you are the following:

- Prefer idiomatic Rust and patterns; as it usually describes your code's intent the most universally.
- Stay consistent and concise; try not to make things more complicated than they need to be.
- Be human; we're all just trying to build cool things using awesome tools. Don't be afraid to share either!

## Working Locally

See our examples [here](https://github.com/leptix/leptix/tree/master/examples)

## Preparing Pull Requests

Prefer many small commits/PRs describing changes rather than submitting single large changes, this makes it easier for
everybody to digest.
